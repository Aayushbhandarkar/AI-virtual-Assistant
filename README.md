ðŸ¤– Virtual AI Assistant

This project is a Virtual AI Assistant that I built with a focus on modern UI/UX, intelligent response handling, and personalization features.
Unlike a basic chatbot, this version combines voice interaction, AI-powered conversations, secure authentication, and customization options to make it feel like a real-world assistant.
